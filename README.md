## codes explaination
**alex.py / VGG.py**: Define the structure of AlexNet and VGG16. Train on CIFAR10 dataset.

**test_inject.py**: Test the hook function to inject faults into specific layer.

**random_alex.py / random_vgg.py**: Check the random injection effects on AlexNet and VGG16.

**injection.py**: Main body of the fault injection, with the injection environment and agent inside.

**read_draw.py**: Visualization of the agent training and injection results.

**image_visualization.py**: Qualitative evaluation about the effectiveness of RL agent injection.
